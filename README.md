# Cardiac_Gastruloids
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of cardiac gastruloids for Rossi et al. 2020

# Data exploration
We recommend to download the data from GEO, install R-studio and Seurat v3, and use the file Explore_Data.R for a quick dive into cell annotations and gene expression, and to be setup for further exploration in R. 

# Analysis reproduction
To reproduce the complete analysis, obtain the raw data from Rossi et al. 2020 as well as Pijuan-Sala et al. 2019, used as a reference in vivo atlas. Install all dependencies listed in SessionInfo.txt, and run CardiacGastruloidsAnalysis.R, followed by the jupyter lab notebooks for RNA-velocity with [scVelo](https://github.com/theislab/scvelo).
